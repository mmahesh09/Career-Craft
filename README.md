> "43% of job seekers admit they don't tailor resumes to specific jobs, missing crucial keywords and increasing rejection risk."

> "Resumes that match 50% or fewer keywords from a job description are almost always rejected by ATS systems."

## Problem Statement

Job seekers often struggle with tailoring their resumes to specific job descriptions, resulting in missed opportunities. 43% of applicants don’t customize their resumes, neglecting important keywords that are vital for job matching. Additionally, resumes that don’t match at least 50% of the job description’s keywords are typically rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). This project aims to address this problem by developing a tool that analyzes both resumes and job descriptions, suggesting relevant keyword optimizations to enhance keyword alignment and increase the likelihood of passing through ATS and catching the attention of hiring managers.

## Agenda

This project is a comprehensive *Resume and Job Description Analyzer** developed using the *MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)*, designed to streamline the job application process for both job seekers and recruiters. The platform allows users to upload their resumes and input job descriptions to generate tailored keyword analysis, match scores, and actionable suggestions for optimization. It leverages advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract keywords and assess the alignment between resumes and job descriptions, helping users identify skill gaps, enhance keyword relevance, and optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

A key feature of the platform is the User Project Section, where users can share their personal projects, complete with detailed descriptions, relevant tags, and direct links to demos or source code repositories. This collaborative space fosters networking, inspiration, and knowledge sharing, while also providing recruiters with a richer profile of potential candidates.
